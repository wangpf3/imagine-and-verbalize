# IMAGINATION Module for Generative Commonsense Reasoning

## Training
Excute run.sh under scripts folder.

We provide a sub set sampled from the complete skg datasets as the original files are too large.

## Inference
Excute evaluate.sh under scripts folder.

This is for obtaining silver-standard SKGs of downstream datasets.

## Used in the verbalization inference
The folder saving the imagination module checkpoint would be used for inference in the verbalization module. Check the details there.
